    <p>
      My baby jojo,
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for saying yes. That simple answer means more to me than you know.
      I don’t take your love, your time, or your heart for granted.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m so grateful for you, my pretty babyyy, for your patience, your sweetness, your laughter,
      and the way you make ordinary days feel special.
      Being with you is something I truly cherish.
    </p>

    <p>
      I know we're young, still a bit childish, and sometimes makulit,
      and all those times that we argued and misunderstood each other
      doesn't make me love you less. Knowing you more and more every
      single second, minute, hour, day, week, month, year makes me love
      you more and more. Stay with me, and I promise I'll stick with
      you, until the sun dies, the moon out-orbits, the universe ends.
      Kasi kung maging successful na tayo, tayo pa rin dapat magkasama,
      through thick and thin, through highs and lows, through everything.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love you. Not just today, not just because it’s Valentine’s season,
      but in the quiet, everyday moments too, mwa mwaahh mwa.
      And I promise to keep choosing you, appreciating you,
      and doing my best to make you feel loved the way you deserve. ;)
    </p>

    <p>
      Now just wait for Valentine’s Day…
      I have something special planned for you. :>
    </p>

    <div class="signature">
      Always yours,<br>
